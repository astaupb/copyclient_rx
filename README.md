# AStA Copyclient App (copyclient_rx)

This app is the main client used for printing with [AStAPrint/PAStA](https://git.uni-paderborn.de/asta/astaprint).

Through it users can register themselves, load credit on their account and upload docuemnts they want to print.
It also offers modes to get documents you scan from a printer and optionally direct-print them for a 'copy' mode.

## Building and Getting Started

To get the last running dependency configuration run `flutter packages get`, if you want the latest versions run `flutter upgrade`.

To start the app on your smartphone via USB or inside an emulator just `flutter run` and have fun.

To build an Android or iOS App use `flutter build apk` or open the XCode workspace inside the ios folder to 'Archive' the app through XCode.
